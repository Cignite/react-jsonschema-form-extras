# react-jsonschema-form-extras

## Usage

FormWithExtras is a wrapper for Mozilla's JSON Schema Form that adds extra useful components.

Use this project as you would use Mozilla's JSON Schema Form (see their documentation), but to leverage the extra widgets just reference them in the ui:widget parameter.
